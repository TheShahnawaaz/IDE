## Getting Started

### Editor Interface

The IDE is divided into several key areas:

1. **Toolbar**: Access language selection, file operations, and run buttons
2. **File Explorer**: Navigate and manage your files and folders (toggle with the hamburger icon)
3. **Editor**: Write and edit your code
4. **Console/Test Cases**: View output, provide input, and manage test cases
5. **Status Bar**: See current status and execution information

### Basic Operations

#### File Management

- **Create a new file**: Click the document-plus icon or use `Ctrl+N`
- **Open a file**: Click the folder icon or use `Ctrl+O`
- **Save a file**: Click the download icon or use `Ctrl+S`
- **Close a file**: Click the X on the file tab or use `Ctrl+W`
- **Toggle file explorer**: Click the hamburger icon or use `Ctrl+B`

#### Organizing Your Workspace

- **Create folders**: Right-click in the file explorer and select "New Folder"
- **Drag and drop**: Move files between folders by dragging them
- **Rename files/folders**: Right-click and select "Rename" or double-click the file tab
- **Archive files**: Move unused files to the Archive folder for better organization

#### Writing Code

- **Change language**: Select your desired language from the dropdown
- **Format code**: Click the code bracket icon or use `Shift+Alt+F`
- **Change theme**: Select from light, dark, or high contrast themes

#### Running Code

- **Run code**: Click the green play button or press `F5`
- **Provide input**: Enter input in the input panel before running
- **View output**: See results in the output panel
- **Clear input/output**: Use the clear buttons to reset the panels

### Working with Test Cases

1. **Create a test case**:
   - Go to the "Test Cases" tab
   - Enter input and expected output
   - Click "Add Test Case"

2. **Run test cases**:
   - Run a single test case by clicking the "Run" button next to it
   - Run all test cases by clicking "Run All Test Cases"
   - View detailed results in the "Results" tab

3. **Manage test cases**:
   - Edit or delete test cases as needed
   - Test cases are saved automatically

## Common Use Cases

### Competitive Programming

Perfect for competitive programming practice:

1. Write your solution in the editor
2. Create test cases for sample inputs/outputs
3. Run test cases to verify your solution
4. Run with custom inputs for edge cases

### Learning a New Language

1. Select your target language from the dropdown
2. Create basic programs to understand syntax
3. Run small code segments to see how they work
4. Use the console for input/output experimentation

### Educational Use

Teachers and students can:

1. Share code through the save/load functionality
2. Create test cases to validate student solutions
3. Use the workspace organization to manage multiple assignments
4. Use the Archive folder to store reference solutions

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+N`: New file
- `Ctrl+O`: Open file
- `Ctrl+S`: Save file
- `Ctrl+W`: Close file
- `F5`: Run code
- `Shift+Alt+F`: Format code
- `Ctrl+B`: Toggle file explorer

## Tips and Tricks

- **Use the Archive folder** to keep your workspace organized while maintaining access to reference files
- **Create template files** for frequently used code patterns
- **Use test cases** even for simple programs to ensure correctness
- **Customize your layout** based on whether you're working with input-heavy or output-heavy programs
- **Drag the dividers** to resize the file explorer and console panels

## Troubleshooting

- If code execution fails, check the selected language and ensure it matches your code
- If test cases aren't running, verify that your code reads input in the expected format
- If the interface seems unresponsive, try refreshing the page (your work is auto-saved)
